# Wplace Pixel Timer

A live countdown timer that calculates how long it will take to place all remaining pixels in a pixel-placing system, with a colorful progress bar.

## How to Use

1. **Open the above URL** in a browser.  
2. **Enter your current pixels placed** in the first input box.  
3. **Enter your total pixels** in the second input box.  
4. The timer will **automatically start counting down** as soon as you finish typing.  
5. The **time remaining** is displayed in hours, minutes, and seconds.  
6. The **progress bar** shows your completion percentage, updating live as pixels “accumulate.”  

**Notes:**  
- Default values start at `0/0`.  
- Each pixel is assumed to take **30 seconds**.  
- No start button is needed — countdown begins automatically.
